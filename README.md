<h1> Learning C programming </h1>

<h2> Topics: </h2>

<h3> Data structures and algorithm, functional programming, pointers and many more </h3>

This repository contains all the projects for mastering low-level programming from the ALX-Africa Software engineering programm (check their site at [https://www.alxafrica.com/](https://www.alxafrica.com/) for more details)

<h4> List of folders (various projects) </h4>

* The [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world/) covers the introduction of C and its compilation routines (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking). The task also shows the use of stdout functions like puts, printf, and write.

* The [0x01-Variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while/) contains the project for conditional operators (statements).

* [0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops/) shows how to design functions and declare them, show some interesting nested loop examples

* [0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging/) covers how to use commenting to debug script. Its just simple but complex debugging tools can be used for this

* [0x04-more_funcitons_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/) more on funcitons and nested loops

* [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/) covers introduction to pointers and arrays in C (eg. access memmory address and dereferencing)

* [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/) covers advance tasks on pointers and arrays

* [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/) covers more advance tasks on pointers and arrays

* [0x08-recursion](./0x08-recursion/) introduce the use of functions with a function in C (recursion)

* [0x0A-argc_argv](./0x0A-argc_argv/) covers how main funciton of C is used to accept arguments from the command line

* [0x09-static_libraries](./0x09-static_libraries/) covers how to generate static libraries from C source codes (archiving and indexing)

* [0x0B-malloc_free](./0x0B-malloc_free/) introduce the concept of dynamic memory allocation

* [0x0C-more_malloc_free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free/)

* [0x0D-preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor/)

* [0x0E-structures_typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef/)

* [0x0F-function_pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers/)

* [0x10-variadic_functions](./0x10-variadic_functions/)
