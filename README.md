# alx-low_level_programming
This repository contains all the project files for low-level programming in the ALX-SE program

* The [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world/) covers the introduction of C and its compilation routines (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking). The task also shows the use of stdout functions like puts, printf, and write.

* The [0x01-Variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while/) contains the project for conditional operators (statements).

* [0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops/) shows how to design functions and declare them, show some interesting nested loop examples

* [0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging/) covers how to use commenting to debug script. Its just simple but complex debugging tools can be used for this

* [0x04-more_funcitons_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/) more on funcitons and nested loops

* [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/) covers introduction to pointers and arrays in C (eg. access memmory address and dereferencing)

* [Pointers and arrays](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/)

* [More on pointers and arrays](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/)

* [C recursion](./0x08-recursion/)

* [Argc and Argv](./0x0A-argc_argv/)
