* 0-strcat.c - function that concatenates two strings

* 1-strncat.c - a function that concatenates two strings The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, 
  except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

* 2-strncpy.c - function that copies string

* 3-strcmp.c - function that compares two strings

* 4-rev_array.c -  function that reverses the content of an array of integers

* 5-string_toupper.c - function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase

* 6-cap_string.c - function that capitalizes all words of a string

* 7-leet.c - Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
            Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
            Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
            Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
            Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
            Letters l and L should be replaced by 1

* 100-rot13.c - function that encodes a string using rot13.

* 101-print_number.c - function that prints integer
