## Low level programming (with C language)
This repository basically covers the introduction of C programming with the various level of converting source code into executables (preprocessing, compiling, assembling and linking)

* Ex0: gcc -E $CFILE  use the GNU gcc compiler to run the source code through preprocessor 

* Ex1: gcc -c $CFILE  compile the source code without linking 

* Ex2: gcc -S $CFILE  generate assemblage code from the source code 

* Ex3: gcc $CFILE -o cisfun  compile the source code to generate the executable file cisfun
